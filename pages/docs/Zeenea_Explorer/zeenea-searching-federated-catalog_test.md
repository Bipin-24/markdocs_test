# Searching in the Federated Catalog

## Single Interface

In the federated catalog, end-users can search and explore the data landscape of the whole organization through a single interface: Zeenea Explorer.

Based on your user groups and related catalog access rights, you can perform searches among all your items and also items that have been shared in the Marketplace by any catalog, in the same place.

You can identify the catalog to which each item belongs by the **catalog** badge in the search results. You can also refine your search by filtering items by the catalogs you are interested in.

## Item Visibility

In the Explorer, you have full access to the documentation for items in your catalogs and for shared items in the marketplace.

Items from catalogs for which you do not have read permission are not included in search results.

Marketplace items can be linked to items in catalogs you do not have access to. In the Explorer, these links are hidden except in lineage, where only the name and connection of the unshared items appear.

To provide more sealing between catalogs, you can disable the **Lineage** tab in the Explorer by submitting a request to your Customer Success Manager. The **Lineage** tab remains accessible in the Studio.

In the Studio, search is filtered for one catalog at a time. However, curators can still see links to items from other catalogs.

## Topics and Marketplace

Topics are also available in the Federated Catalog. Catalog curators are responsible for defining topics for their perimeter. Therefore, topics offer a way to create entry points to explore and search inside a single catalog.

There is an exception with the Marketplace topic. This built-in topic is available to all Explorers and groups all shared items in the federation regardless of their catalog.
