# Zeenea Explorer Overview

Zeenea Explorer wants to further support users' exploratory approaches, beyond our search capabilities based on metadata indexing, scoring and filtering, already present in our first application Zeenea Studio.

## Who is Zeenea Explorer for?

Zeenea Explorer is aimed directly at data teams, the end consumers of company data.

The application aims to simplify their daily life by allowing them to search and discover quickly and easily the internal information within their company data or from open data.

## What are its main assets?

Zeenea has separated the exploratory experience from its data catalog in its Zeenea Explorer application to provide a better user experience for data consumers.

Zeenea Explorer is the front-office application of our data catalog.

Drawing inspiration from e-commerce websites, it offers very simple ergonomics based on research, exploration and collaboration of data and their uses.

Its objectives are:

* To search in a customized way through a data catalog filled with thousands of information.
* To provide a profiling of the items inventoried in Zeenea, presenting statistical signatures in the form of graphs, very useful for a synthetic analytical reading.
* To refine the display of documentation according to one’s needs, profile or role to get to the essentials in the research.
* To suggest complementary items to the different users as soon as they connect, based on their history and profile.
* To be a workspace for data teams during a use case.
