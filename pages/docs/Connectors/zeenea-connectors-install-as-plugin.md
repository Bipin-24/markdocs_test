# Installing and Configuring Connectors as a Plugin

Zeenea next-generation connectors are now available as plugins. This new approach allows for easier installation and faster roll-out of new versions and features.

Follow these steps to install or update your plugin connector:

1. Download the latest version of the connector from [Zeenea Connector Downloads](./zeenea-connectors-list.md).
2. Stop the scanner.
3. Move the downloaded `connector-plugin-1.0.zip` file directly into the `plugins` folder of your scanner. 
   > **Important:** Do not unzip the archive.
4. In case of an update, make sure to delete the previous version of the plugin (both the ZIP file and the folder) before proceeding.
5. In case of installing a new connector, configure the new connector as specified in its dedicated documentation. 
   > **Note:** You can find links to all connector configuration documentation in [Zeenea Connector Downloads](./zeenea-connectors-list.md).
6. Restart the scanner.
