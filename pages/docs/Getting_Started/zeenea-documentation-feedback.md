# Providing Documentation Feedback

We welcome and encourage your feedback on the platform and documentation. Feedback from the user community plays an important role in improving the product.

Let us know if:

* Anything is missing, unclear, or inaccurate in the documentation. 
* There are topics you'd like to see.
* You have suggestions for documentation improvements.
* There's something that really helped and you'd like to see more of it!

There are two ways to provide your feedback on the documentation: 

* Submit a message using the **Page Feedback** button.
* Use the **Suggest Edits** button to edit the page in GitHub.

## Page Feedback

Entering page feedback is easy, and available to anyone. There is a **Page Feedback** button on the bottom of every page:
