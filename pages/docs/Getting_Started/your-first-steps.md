# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

This documentation explains how to get started with the **Zeenea platform** and introduces the main user roles.

## User Roles

Choose the role that best matches your responsibilities to learn how to use Zeenea effectively:

{% callout type="check" %}
- **[Super Admin](/docs/zeenea-superadmin):**  The Super Admin role is often shared among multiple collaborators to cover the technical and functional responsibilities of the platform.

- **[Data Steward](/docs/zeenea-data-steward):**  Data Stewards are responsible for documenting, maintaining, and managing the catalog items assigned to them.

- **[Data Explorer](/docs/zeenea-data-explorer):** Data Explorers use the dedicated data discovery application to search, explore, and understand available data assets.

{% /callout %}
