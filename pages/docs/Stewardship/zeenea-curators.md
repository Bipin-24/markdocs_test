# Assigning and Removing Curators

A curator is responsible for documenting a specific object. Curators serve as the primary point of contact for any question related to an item’s documentation status. 

You can assign one or more curators to any type of item in the catalog. 

## Find Curators

To find curators for an item, follow these steps:

1. In the Studio, open the item’s overview or details page.
2. Go to the **PEOPLE** tab.
   The **CURATOR** section lists all assigned curators.
3. Hover over a curator’s avatar to view their detailed information, such as name, responsibility, email, and so on.

## Assign Curators

To assign curators to a single item, follow these steps:

1. In the Studio, open the item's overview or details page.
2. In the **PEOPLE** tab, click the **Assign curator** button in the **CURATOR** section.
   The **Assign curator** dialog appears.
3. Select one or more curators from the list of available users.
4. Click **Confirm**.

To assign curators to multiple items at once, follow these steps:

1. In the Studio, select the items from the search results.
2. Click the **Edit** button.
3. Click **Assign curator**.
   The **Assign curator** dialog appears.
4. Select one or more curators from the list of available users.
5. Click **Confirm**.

{% /callout %}

## Remove Curators

To remove curators from an item, follow these steps:

1. In the Studio, open the item's overview or details page.
2. In the **PEOPLE** tab, click the **Remove** button next to the curator you want to remove in the **CURATOR** section.
3. Click **Confirm**.

## Specific Case: Fields

Dataset curators will be inherited by the **Fields**. These inherited curators cannot be removed.

However, in addition to the inherited curators, you can manually add new curators. These manually added curators are managed like any other curators, so you can add or remove them as needed.
