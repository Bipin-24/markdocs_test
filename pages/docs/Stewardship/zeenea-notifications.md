# How Notifications Work

Zeenea Studio offers a notification system that is accessible to the application users.



## Types of Notifications Per User

Each time a new notification is received or read, the increment is updated on the pictogram.

The table below lists the different notifications available depending on the user profile.

The notification remains accessible until the user has clicked on it or the **Mark all as read** link.
