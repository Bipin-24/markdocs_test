# Creating, Editing, or Deleting a Topic

Topics allow you to define collections of Objects to help your business users understand the concepts contained in the catalog and guide their searches.

To manage Topics, you must have the **Catalog Design** permission enabled on your user group.

## Creating a Topic

To create a Topic:

1. Go to the Catalog section, on the search results page.
2. Select the filters you are interested in to create your custom collection.
3. Click the **Save filters as** button on the top-right of the screen and then select **New Topic**.
4. Fill in the requested information and click **Confirm**.

The following information is required to create a Topic:

* **Name**: This name will be used on the Zeenea Explorer home page to help business users
* **Description**: This is displayed for Zeenea Explorer users
* **Color**: The selected color will be applied to the Topic to give a visual cue to business users and help them find their way through the list

## Editing a Topic

Once a new Topic is created, you can still modify some of its characteristics by clicking on the pencil icon presented in front of each custom type name in the **Topics** section.

{% callout type="info" %}
The filters of the Topic cannot be modified. You can only modify the name, description, and color of a Topic.
{% /callout %}

## Deleting a Topic

You can delete a Topic at any time if it is no longer useful. 

When you delete a Topic, it will no longer be available to the business users who used it in the Explorer.
