# How Discussion Threads Work

The discussion system is available in Zeenea Studio and Explorer from the **Datasets** object detail pages. This feature allows users to interact within discussion threads.

{% callout type="info" %}
**Note:** Threads are made visible to all Zeenea Studio and Explorer users and are permanent over time.
{% /callout %}

From this section, any logged-in user can:

* Create a new thread
* Reply to a thread already created by another user
* Edit one of their own messages already submitted by clicking on the "pen" icon in the top right-hand corner.
